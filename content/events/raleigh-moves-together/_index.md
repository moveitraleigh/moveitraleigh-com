## What Is Raleigh Moves Together?

“Raleigh Moves Together Workshop” is a FREE workshop to be held at CC & Co. Dance Complex for dancers that are enrolled in middle and high school dance programs in Wake County to provide access to classes with professional educators and choreographers. During this 6 hour workshop, the dancers will not only take classes but will participate in "talk-backs" with the guest artists, where the dancers can ask questions and receive feedback as well as mentorship opportunities.  This day will include contemporary, hip hop, jazz, musical theatre, and commercial dance classes of varying levels. At the end of the day, all dancers will have the opportunity to participate in a commercial video project.

The mission of "Raleigh Moves Together Workshop" is to give every dancer in Wake County an opportunity to explore and grow their talents within the dance arena and connect them to the possibilities of dance as a vocation regardless of their financial means.
